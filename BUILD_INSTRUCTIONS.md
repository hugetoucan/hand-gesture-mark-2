# 🚀 Build Instructions for Hand Gesture Mark 2

## Quick Build on Your Computer

### Prerequisites:
- Android Studio installed
- Java 17 or higher

### Steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
cd C:\Users\USR\Desktop
git clone https://github.com/crajveer1212-dotcom/hand-gesture-mark-2.git
cd hand-gesture-mark-2
```

2. **MediaPipe Model:** already included in the repository at `app/src/main/assets/hand_landmarker.task`. If you need to refresh it, download from:
- https://storage.googleapis.com/mediapipe-models/hand_landmarker/hand_landmarker/float16/latest/hand_landmarker.task
- Save to: `app/src/main/assets/hand_landmarker.task`

3. **Open in Android Studio:**
- File → Open
- Select the `hand-gesture-mark-2` folder
- Wait for Gradle sync (2-3 minutes)

4. **Build APK:**
- Build → Generate Signed Bundle / APK
- Select APK
- Click Next
- Click "Create new..." if you don't have a keystore (or skip signing for debug)
- Click Finish

OR simply:
- Build → Build Bundle(s) / APK(s) → Build APK(s)

5. **Find your APK:**
```
app\build\outputs\apk\debug\app-debug.apk
```

### Troubleshooting:

**If Gradle sync fails:**
- File → Invalidate Caches / Restart
- Try again

**If model download fails:**
- Download manually from the URL above
- Place in `app/src/main/assets/` folder

**If build fails:**
- Check that Java 17 is installed
- Check that Android SDK is installed
- Try: Build → Clean Project, then rebuild

### Alternative - Use Command Line:

```bash
# On Windows
gradlew.bat assembleDebug

# On Mac/Linux

```

APK will be in: `app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`
